### CSC207 Project Notes - Human ###

# HUMAN #

# Made 2 classes: HumanEngine & HumanActivity

# Created the HumanActivity class that implements Activity

# Note: when I first committed the HumanActivity and HumanEngine files they didn't show up on
        Markus but I had my own local copy so I just copy/pasted all the code


# Got rid of unnecessary comments
