       at student services with your student ID and password to ACORN! Then you proceed to lecture and
       learn some knowledge on a variety of topics from geography to english! After a challenging
       lecture you decide you're going to need some coffee so you head to the local coffee shop and
       get as much coffee as you can to get you through the day! Finally it's time for your exam.
       This exam is going to be pretty tough and you're ready to take on the challenge your
       professor has brought upon you. After a brutal exam you are ready to go home and start this
       journey all over again!
